# Notes

- Added "resolutions" section to root package.json. This is from this [open issue](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/issues/654) in react-window. Instructions for "resolutions" from yarn is [here](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#resolutions). It is required that it be put in the root package.json specifically. There do not seem to be any problems with this for now.
